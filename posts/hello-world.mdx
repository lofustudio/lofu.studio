## Introduction.

Hey there, and welcome to the first major version of the lofu studio website.
This is the first time lofu.studio has had a *stable* site, and I'm excited to
share it with you. Today, I'm going to be talking about the site, and what should
be expected from it in the future.

lofu.studio is our official website, and it's where you can find all of our
projects, and information about them. We want Lofu to be as transparent as possible, so we will
also have a blog which will contain updates about the company, our projects, and behind the scenes stuff.
